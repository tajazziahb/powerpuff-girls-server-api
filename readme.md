# ðŸ’– Powerpuff Girls API

A playful server-side web app that fetches and displays data about your favorite Powerpuff Girls â€” **Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup!**  
Type a characterâ€™s name into the input box and instantly see their image, color, personality, voice actor, and more pop onto the screen.

## Tech Stack
**Node.js + Express.js** **HTML**  **CSS** **JavaScript**  

---

## How It Works
Users enter the name of a Powerpuff Girl into the input field and click the button to fetch data.  
The app retrieves the corresponding characterâ€™s image, color, personality, and other details, then displays them dynamically in a clear two-column layout â€” labels on the left, values on the right.  
Each image appears above the data, creating a simple, fun, and interactive experience that feels true to the Powerpuff Girlsâ€™ playful energy.

## How Itâ€™s Made
This project was built using a lightweight **Express.js** server to deliver both static files and a custom API response.  
The frontend uses **JavaScript** to fetch and render data dynamically, while **CSS** handles all visuals and animations.  
The layout is organized with responsive grids, ensuring that the app looks balanced on both desktop and mobile.  
Every element was designed with clarity and contrast in mind, emphasizing a clean separation between structure, style, and behavior.
